FAQ
===

Why make this?
 I found ktouch's interface sexy and beautiful but its default lessons were
 preventing me from making it to the next level. It seems like their ought to
 be a large repository of CC licensed ktouch lessons but it was easier to make
 this.

Who helped?
 Well it's just me, Spencer, on the active side of things. But big shoutouts to
 http://1bnr.wordpress.com/ and http://networking.ringofsaturn.com/Web/removetags.php
 They were both very helpful.
