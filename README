========

Actually pretty much works. If you don't run ktouch in widescreen you can change 
the number of characters per line.

Installing
==========

Ktouch-wiki-gen uses:
*Python2.7
*BeautifulSoup
*ktouch

Run ./ktouch-wiki-gen
*you may have to alter the first line of the program depending on your path

It will generate a .ktouch.xml file in an output directory.
In ktouch go to File -> Open Lecture, and navigate to the generated file.
In Settings -> Ktouch settings -> Training Options you can disable typwritter mode
which will make turn off the "enter after every line" behavior. 


FAQ
===

Why make this?
 I found ktouch's interface sexy and beautiful but its default lessons were
 preventing me from making it to the next level. It seems like their ought to
 be a large repository of CC licensed ktouch lessons but it was easier to make
 this.

Who helped?
 Well it's just me, Spencer, on the active side of things. Thanks to Alevar as well.But big shoutouts to
 http://1bnr.wordpress.com/ and http://networking.ringofsaturn.com/Web/removetags.php
 They were both very helpful. 

Why do I have to hit enter all the time?
 You don't. In Settings -> Ktouch settings -> Training Options you can disable typwritter mode
 which will make turn off the "enter after every line" behavior.
